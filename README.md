# bbclock
bbclock is a now archived project, which was made for my sister back in 2018. The website’s primary function was to provide my sister with tracking the babysitter’s time. Since the website is no longer online, I wanted to back up the source code for future reference.

## Setup
If you want to run this website, just spin up an Apache, PHP, and MySQL stack and put this in the web directory.
